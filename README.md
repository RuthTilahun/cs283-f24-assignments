### **Description**
*Maze of Redemption* is a 3D puzzle-adventure game where the player navigates a maze to find hidden puzzle pieces. Each collected piece reveals a part of the maze map, guiding the player closer to the end. Once all the pieces are collected, the exit gate opens, marking the completion of the adventure.
